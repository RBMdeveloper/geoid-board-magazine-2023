The area, whose boundaries are not universally agreed upon, has a vaguely triangular shape marked by the Atlantic coast of the Florida panhandle (in the United States), Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles.</p>

                    <h1>The Nazca lines</h1>
                    <p>Nazca Lines, Nazca also spelled Nasca, groups of geoglyphs, large line drawings that appear, from a distance, to be etched into Earth’s surface on the arid Pampa Colorada (“Coloured Plain” or “Red Plain”), northwest of the city of Nazca in southern Peru. They extend over an area of nearly 190 square miles (500 square km).
                        Most of the Nazca Lines were constructed more than 2,000 years ago by the people of the Nazca culture (c. 200 BCE–600 CE), though some clearly predate the Nazca and are considered to be the work of the earlier Paracas culture.</p>

                    <h1>The Eternal Flame Falls</h1>
                    <p>Eternal Flame Falls is a 35-foot waterfall and one of its grottos actually contains a small flickering flame about 8 inches high and believed to be lit thousands of years ago by Native Americans. For a long time, scientists have believed that the fire burns because of gas pockets that rise from the old, extremely hot bedrock made of shale. The rock's high temperatures break down the carbon molecules in the shale, which in turn creates natural gas.</p>

                    <h1>Pink Lake Australia</h1>
                    <p>Pink Lake is a salt lake in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia. Although historically the water in the lake was visibly pink, as of 2017 it had not been pink for over ten years. Salt concentration is vital to Pink Lake's pink hue, and Pink Lake may turn pink again as conditions change.</p>

                    <h1>Sailing stones of Death Valley</h1>
                    <p>Sailing stones (also called sliding rocks, walking rocks, rolling stones, and moving rocks) are part of the geological phenomenon in which rocks move and inscribe long tracks along a smooth valley floor without animal intervention. The movement of the rocks occurs when large, thin sheets of ice floating on an ephemeral winter pond break up in the sun. Frozen during cold winter nights, these thin, floating ice panels are driven by wind and shove rocks at speeds up to 5 m (16 feet) per minute.</p>

                    <p>About 100 kilometres from the Atlantic coast, the Namibian desert is dotted with millions of “fairy circles”: circular gaps in the grassland, a few metres in diameter.There is some resemblance to Australian spinifex circles, but there the connection ends.Scientists have been debating the origins of the Namibian fairy circles for decades.Researchers have theorised that they’re caused by termites, or that the plants were somehow being prompted to grow like this on their own.</p>

                    <h1>The Crooked Forest</h1>
                    <p>The Crooked Forest is a grove of 400 oddly shaped pine trees located near the town of Gryfino, West Pomerania in Poland. The pine trees were planted around 1930 when its location was still within the German province of Pomerania.

                        From the base, the pine trees grow with a 90-degree sharp bend northward, but then curve back to grow straight up into the sky. Despite the unnatural curves bending three to nine feet sideways at their bases, these trees are generally healthy and grow up to 50 feet tall.</p>
